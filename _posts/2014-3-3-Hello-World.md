title: About myself!

Hello, my name is Ãžorvaldur and I am from Iceland. I am studying Industrial Engineering at the University of Iceland but for this semester I will be staying in Madrid where I am studying at ICAI. My interest are football and reading which I try to do during my freetime.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
