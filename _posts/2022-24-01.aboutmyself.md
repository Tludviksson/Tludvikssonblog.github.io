# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

Hello, my name is Ãžorvaldur and I am from Iceland. I am studying Industrial Engineering at the University of Iceland but for this semester 
I will be staying in Madrid where I am studying at ICAI. My interest are football and reading which I try to do during my freetime.
